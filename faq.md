FAQ

  * __Q: Can sites generated from MDwiki be crawled and indexed by search engines like Google?__
    A: Yes, with some additional work. There is no user-friendly, easy solution yet, but we are working on it. Take for example [www.notesync.org] which is running MDwiki and fully indexed by google. We are still evaluating best solutions to make the same techniques easily accesible for everyone.

  * __Q: Why aren't there more questions in the FAQ?__
    A: Because nobody asked a question. You can do so by [opening up an issue][issues].
